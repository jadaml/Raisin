Goals
=====

The initial goals of Raisin, is the followings.

* Provide the common framework for all games
* Raisin should be functional no matter how bugous is the supplied game, or how
  much is intact.---aisin should be able to run without any support file without
crashing with ie. a seg-fault.
* A game can be scripted
* Raisin should provide debug features for game creation.---Running Raisin
  without a game brings up a "console"
* The game content can be any license, regardless of Raisin's license.
* And last, but not least: PORTABLE

What is achieved yet
--------------------

For sure? This GitRepo. :P

I've done some studies on what and how should I achieve. Maybe I write some
documents about it, but more likely I write them in code finally.

Technology
----------

* C/C++ (Objective-C++ to wrap some NextStep classes for Mac)
* SDL (Changeable at compile time; ie. Allegro)
* OpenGL (Optional---Future plan)
* ...more?
