# Goals #

The initial goals of Raisin, is the followings.

* Provide the common framework for all games
* Raisin should be functional no matter how bugous is the supplied game, or how
  much is intact.—raisin should be able to run without any support file
without crashing with ie. a seg-fault.
* A game can be scripted–Hence you can focus on writing a complex game (complex game-play/story)
* Raisin should provide debug features for game creation.—Running Raisin
  without a game, would brings up a “console”
* The game content can be any license, regardless of Raisin's license.
* And last, but not least: PORTABLE

## What is achieved so far ##

For sure? This GitRepo. :P

I've done some studies on what and how should I achieve. Maybe I write some
documents about it, but more likely I write them in code finally.

## Technology ##

* C/C++ (Objective-C++ to wrap some NextStep classes for Mac)
* SDL (Changeable at compile time; ie. to Allegro)
* OpenGL (Optional—Future plan)
* ...more?
